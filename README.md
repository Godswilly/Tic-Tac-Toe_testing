This project uses Ruby to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played in the Terminal.

## How To Play

'Tic, Tac, Toe' is a traditional game for two players played on a board with 9 squares.

Each player is represented by a symbol, either 'X' or 'O', which they then take turns to place in an empty square on the board, with O's going first.

The aim of the game is to have three of your symbols form a line, be it vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

In the event that all 9 squares are taken without either player getting three of their symbols in a line, a draw is declared.
